Flappy Bird, which was released back in 2013 and sadly removed in 2014 by its developer Dong Nguyen, inpsired me to recreate the game due to the challenging 
entertainment it brought.

This project was made purely out of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

The objective of the game is very simple!

Directions:
1) Click anywhere on the screen to help your bird fly!
2) Fly between the pipes to score 1 point.
3) Do not touch the pipes, or you lose!
4) Have fun!

Challenge your friends and family to see who can score the most points!

Unfinished functionalities and/or imperfections:

1) Pipes continue past the canvas borders.
